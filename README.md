## ✅ Stage 1: Python Fundamentals

* [ ]  Set up Python (latest) + VSCode or PyCharm
* [ ]  Variables, data types, operators
* [ ]  Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* [ ]  Loops (`for`, `while`)
* [ ]  Functions & return values
* [ ]  Input/output
* [ ]  String operations
* [ ]  List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary
* [ ]  List comprehension
* [ ]  Basic error handling (`try`, `except`)


## ✅ Stage 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* [ ]  Classes & Objects
* [ ]  `__init__` method
* [ ]  `self` keyword
* [ ]  Inheritance & method overriding
* [ ]  Polymorphism
* [ ]  Encapsulation & abstraction
* [ ]  Magic methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)



## ✅ Stage 3: Pythonic Essentials

* [ ]  `*args` and `**kwargs`
* [ ]  Lambda functions
* [ ]  Map, Filter, Reduce
* [ ]  Zip, Enumerate
* [ ]  Generators and `yield`
* [ ]  Decorators
* [ ]  Context managers (`with` statement)



## ✅ Stage 4: Pattern Printing & Logic Building (Optional)

* [ ]  Star patterns (triangles, pyramids)
* [ ]  Number patterns
* [ ]  Diamond, hourglass, etc.
* [ ]  ASCII and character patterns
* [ ]  Logical problems (palindrome, factorial, prime check)



## ✅ Stage 5: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

### Basic Data Structures

* [ ]  Arrays / Lists
* [ ]  Strings
* [ ]  Stack (via list or class)
* [ ]  Queue (FIFO, using `deque`)
* [ ]  Hash Map / Dictionary
* [ ]  Set operations

### Intermediate Structures

* [ ]  Linked List (Singly, Doubly)
* [ ]  Recursion
* [ ]  Binary Search
* [ ]  Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick)
* [ ]  Binary Trees
* [ ]  Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
* [ ]  Heap
* [ ]  Graph (adjacency list/matrix)
* [ ]  BFS, DFS

### Algorithms

* [ ]  Sliding Window
* [ ]  Two Pointers
* [ ]  Recursion + Backtracking
* [ ]  Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)
* [ ]  Greedy
* [ ]  Bit Manipulation (Basics)



## ✅ Stage 6: Testing, Debugging & Performance

* [ ]  `print()` debugging
* [ ]  `pdb` or built-in debugger
* [ ]  Writing unit tests using `unittest`
* [ ]  Writing tests with `pytest`
* [ ]  Using `assert` statements
* [ ]  `timeit` for benchmarking
* [ ]  `cProfile` for profiling



## ✅ Stage 7: Real-World Python Skills

* [ ]  File I/O (`open`, read/write files)
* [ ]  CSV, JSON parsing
* [ ]  Working with APIs (requests)
* [ ]  CLI tools with `argparse` or `click`
* [ ]  Environment variables and `.env` files
* [ ]  Virtual environments (`venv`, `pipenv`, `poetry`)
* [ ]  Python project structure (src/ layout)



## ✅ Stage 8: Python Internals (Bonus for Mastery)

* [ ]  How Python handles memory
* [ ]  Mutable vs Immutable types
* [ ]  Understanding the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)
* [ ]  How lists, dicts, sets are implemented internally
* [ ]  CPython vs PyPy vs MicroPython
