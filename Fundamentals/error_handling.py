"""

# Problem 1: Basic Try-Except
# Create a simple try-except block to handle division by zero
# Catch ZeroDivisionError and provide a meaningful message
# Expected output: Error handling demonstration

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Multiple Exception Types
# Handle different types of exceptions in one try block
# Catch ValueError, TypeError, and IndexError
# Expected output: Multiple exception handling

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Exception Hierarchy
# Demonstrate catching base and specific exceptions
# Show how Exception catches all exceptions
# Expected output: Exception hierarchy behavior

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Finally Clause
# Use finally clause to ensure cleanup code runs
# Demonstrate finally with and without exceptions
# Expected output: Finally clause execution

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Else Clause
# Use else clause to run code when no exception occurs
# Combine try-except-else structure
# Expected output: Else clause behavior

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Raising Exceptions
# Use raise statement to create exceptions
# Raise built-in exceptions with custom messages
# Expected output: Exception raising examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Custom Exceptions
# Create custom exception classes
# Inherit from Exception and add custom behavior
# Expected output: Custom exception usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Exception with Arguments
# Pass arguments to exceptions
# Access exception arguments in except block
# Expected output: Exception with arguments

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Nested Exception Handling
# Handle exceptions in nested try-except blocks
# Demonstrate exception propagation
# Expected output: Nested exception handling

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Error Handling
# Create robust functions with comprehensive error handling:
# - File operations with error handling
# - Data validation with exceptions
# - Network operations with error recovery
# Expected output: Practical error handling examples

# Your solution here:
