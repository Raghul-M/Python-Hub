DEBUGGING AND TESTING - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering debugging and testing in Python.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- Print debugging techniques
- Using assert statements
- Basic unit testing with unittest module
- Test-driven development concepts
- Debugging with pdb (basic)
- Common debugging strategies and tools
"""

# Problem 1: Basic Print Debugging
# Create a function with a bug and use print statements to debug it
# Track variable values and execution flow
# Expected output: Debug output showing the issue

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Assert Statements
# Use assert statements to validate function inputs and outputs
# Check data types, value ranges, and function results
# Expected output: Assertion validation

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Basic Unit Testing
# Create a test class with test methods for a simple function
# Use assertEqual, assertTrue, assertFalse
# Expected output: Test execution results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Test Setup and Exceptions
# Use setUp() method and test exception handling
# Test that functions raise expected exceptions
# Expected output: Setup and exception testing

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: PDB Basic Usage
# Use pdb.set_trace() to debug a function
# Navigate with n, s, c commands and inspect variables
# Expected output: PDB debugging session

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Test-Driven Development
# Write a failing test first, then implement the function
# Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
# Expected output: TDD demonstration

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Debugging with Logging
# Use logging module instead of print statements
# Configure different log levels
# Expected output: Logging-based debugging

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Mock Testing
# Use unittest.mock to mock external dependencies
# Test functions that depend on other modules
# Expected output: Mock testing results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Performance Testing
# Write tests to measure function performance
# Use time measurement and assert performance bounds
# Expected output: Performance test results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Integration Testing
# Write tests for multiple components working together
# Test complete workflows and data flow
# Expected output: Integration test results

# Your solution here:
