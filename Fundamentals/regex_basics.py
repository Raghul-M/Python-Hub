# Create simple regex patterns to match:
# - Literal strings

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Character Classes
# Create patterns using character classes:
# - [abc] - any character from a, b, or c

# - [0-9] - any digit
# - [^abc] - any character except a, b, or c
# Expected output: Character class matching

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Predefined Character Classes
# Use predefined character classes:
# - \d - any digit [0-9]
# - \D - any non-digit [^0-9]

# Problem 5: Quantifiers
# Use quantifiers to specify repetition:

# - {n} - exactly n times
# - {n,} - n or more times
