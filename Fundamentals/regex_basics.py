REGULAR EXPRESSIONS - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering regular expressions in Python.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- Regular expression patterns
- re module functions (search, match, findall, sub)
- Character classes and quantifiers
- Groups and capturing
- Common regex patterns for validation
- Replacing and splitting with regex

# Problem 1: Basic Pattern Matching
# Create regex patterns to match: "hello", "world", and "python"
# Use re.search() to find matches in text
# Expected output: Match results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers
# Create patterns using [a-z], [0-9], *, +, ? to match:
# - Any lowercase word
# - Numbers with optional decimal
# - Optional word endings
# Expected output: Character class matching

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Predefined Classes and Anchors
# Use \d, \w, \s, ^, $ to match:
# - Phone numbers starting with digits
# - Words at start/end of string
# - Email-like patterns
# Expected output: Predefined class usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Groups and Capturing
# Create patterns with groups to extract:
# - Name and age from "Name: John, Age: 25"
# - Date components from "2023-12-25"
# Expected output: Captured groups

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Email Validation
# Create regex pattern to validate email addresses
# Handle common formats: user@domain.com
# Expected output: Email validation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Phone Number Validation
# Create patterns for phone numbers:
# - US format: (123) 456-7890
# - International: +1-123-456-7890
# Expected output: Phone validation

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: String Replacement
# Use re.sub() to:
# - Replace all digits with 'X'
# - Convert "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD"
# Expected output: Replacement results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: String Splitting
# Use re.split() to split text by:
# - Multiple delimiters (comma, semicolon, space)
# - Date separators
# Expected output: Split results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Advanced Patterns
# Create patterns for:
# - URLs (http/https)
# - Credit card numbers (masked)
# - Password validation (8+ chars, mixed case)
# Expected output: Advanced pattern matching

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Application
# Parse a log line: "2023-12-25 10:30:45 [INFO] User login successful"
# Extract timestamp, level, and message
# Expected output: Parsed log components
