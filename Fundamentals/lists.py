# Problem 1: List Creation and Indexing
# Create lists using different methods and demonstrate indexing
# Use square brackets, list() constructor, and list comprehension
# Access elements using positive and negative indices
# Expected output: List creation and indexing examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: List Slicing
# Demonstrate list slicing with different parameters
# Use start:end, start:end:step, negative slicing
# Expected output: Various sliced sublists

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Basic List Methods
# Use common list methods: append(), extend(), insert(), remove()
# Add and remove elements from lists
# Expected output: List modification results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: List Search and Manipulation
# Use index(), count(), pop(), clear() methods
# Search for elements and manipulate list content
# Expected output: Search and manipulation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: List Sorting and Reversing
# Use sort(), reverse(), sorted() functions
# Sort lists in ascending/descending order
# Expected output: Sorted and reversed lists

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: List Comprehension
# Create lists using list comprehension
# Use conditional expressions and nested loops
# Expected output: List comprehension examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: List Operations
# Perform list operations: concatenation, repetition, membership
# Use +, *, in operators with lists
# Expected output: List operation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Nested Lists
# Work with nested lists (2D lists)
# Access and modify elements in nested structures
# Expected output: Nested list operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: List Copying
# Demonstrate shallow vs deep copying
# Use copy(), list(), and deepcopy()
# Expected output: Copying examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical List Applications
# Solve real-world problems using lists:
# - Find duplicates in a list
# - Merge sorted lists
# - Rotate list elements
# Expected output: Practical list solutions
