SETS - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering set manipulation in Python.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- Set creation and initialization
- Set methods (add, remove, update, etc.)
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Set comprehension
- Set properties (unique, unordered, mutable)
- Practical set applications

# Problem 1: Set Creation and Basic Operations
# Create sets using different methods and perform basic operations
# Use curly braces, set() constructor, and set comprehension
# Add and remove elements from sets
# Expected output: Set creation and basic operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Set Methods
# Use common set methods: add(), remove(), discard(), update()
# Handle missing elements and modify set content
# Expected output: Set method usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Set Operations
# Perform set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
# Use operators (|, &, -, ^) and methods (union(), intersection(), etc.)
# Expected output: Set operation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Set Comparison
# Compare sets using subset, superset, and equality operations
# Use operators (<=, >=, ==, !=) and methods (issubset(), issuperset())
# Expected output: Set comparison results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Set Comprehension
# Create sets using set comprehension
# Transform data and apply conditions
# Expected output: Set comprehension examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Set Properties
# Demonstrate set properties: uniqueness, unordered nature, mutability
# Show how sets handle duplicates and maintain uniqueness
# Expected output: Set property demonstration

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Frozen Sets
# Work with frozen sets (immutable sets)
# Create frozen sets and demonstrate immutability
# Expected output: Frozen set usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Set Iteration
# Iterate through sets using different methods
# Use for loops, enumerate(), and set methods
# Expected output: Set iteration examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Set Conversion
# Convert between sets and other data structures
# Convert lists, tuples, strings to sets and vice versa
# Expected output: Set conversion examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Set Applications
# Solve real-world problems using sets:
# - Remove duplicates from data
# - Find common elements between collections
# - Set-based data validation
# Expected output: Practical set solutions

# Your solution here:
