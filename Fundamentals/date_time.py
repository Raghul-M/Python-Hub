# Problem 1: Basic Date and Time Objects
# Create current date, time, and datetime objects
# Use datetime.now(), date.today(), datetime.now().time()
# Expected output: Current date and time objects

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Creating Date Objects
# Create date objects using different methods:
# - date() constructor
# - date.fromisoformat()
# - datetime.now().date()
# Expected output: Various date objects

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Creating Time Objects
# Create time objects using different methods:
# - time() constructor
# - time.fromisoformat()
# - datetime.now().time()
# Expected output: Various time objects

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Date and Time Formatting
# Format datetime objects using strftime():
# - "2023-12-25"
# - "December 25, 2023"
# - "25/12/2023 14:30:45"
# Expected output: Formatted date/time strings

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Parsing Date Strings
# Parse date strings using strptime():
# - "2023-12-25" → datetime object
# - "25/12/2023" → datetime object
# - "Dec 25, 2023" → datetime object
# Expected output: Parsed datetime objects

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Date Arithmetic
# Perform date arithmetic with timedelta:
# - Add/subtract days, weeks, months
# - Calculate difference between dates
# Expected output: Date arithmetic results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Time Arithmetic
# Perform time arithmetic:
# - Add/subtract hours, minutes, seconds
# - Handle time wrapping (24-hour cycle)
# Expected output: Time arithmetic results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Working with Components
# Extract and work with date/time components:
# - year, month, day, hour, minute, second
# - weekday, isoweekday
# Expected output: Date/time components

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Timezone Basics
# Work with timezone-aware datetime objects:
# - Create UTC time
# - Convert between timezones (if pytz available)
# Expected output: Timezone operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Applications
# Solve real-world date/time problems:
# - Calculate age from birth date
# - Find next Monday
# - Check if date is weekend
# Expected output: Practical date/time solutions
