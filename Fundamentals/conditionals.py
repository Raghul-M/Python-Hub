CONDITIONALS - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering conditional statements in Python.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- if, elif, else statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Conditional expressions (ternary operator)
- Nested conditionals
- Practical conditional applications

# Problem 1: Basic If Statement
# Create simple if statements with different conditions
# Use comparison operators and boolean values
# Expected output: Basic conditional execution

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: If-Else Statements
# Create if-else statements to handle two possible outcomes
# Use different conditions and demonstrate both branches
# Expected output: If-else execution examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: If-Elif-Else Statements
# Create if-elif-else chains to handle multiple conditions
# Use different comparison operators and logical operators
# Expected output: Multi-branch conditional execution

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Comparison Operators
# Use all comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
# Compare different data types and values
# Expected output: Comparison operator results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Logical Operators
# Use logical operators: and, or, not
# Combine multiple conditions and demonstrate short-circuit evaluation
# Expected output: Logical operator usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Conditional Expressions
# Use ternary operator (conditional expressions)
# Write compact conditional assignments
# Expected output: Ternary operator examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Nested Conditionals
# Create nested if statements and conditional blocks
# Handle complex decision trees
# Expected output: Nested conditional execution

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Membership and Identity
# Use 'in' and 'not in' operators for membership testing
# Use 'is' and 'is not' for identity testing
# Expected output: Membership and identity testing

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Truthiness and Falsiness
# Test truthiness of different values
# Use values in conditional statements
# Expected output: Truthiness evaluation

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Conditional Applications
# Solve real-world problems using conditionals:
# - Grade calculation based on scores
# - Age-based access control
# - Data validation and error handling
# Expected output: Practical conditional solutions
