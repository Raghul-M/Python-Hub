BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering Python's built-in functions.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- Mathematical functions (abs, round, min, max, sum)
- Type conversion functions (int, float, str, list, dict)
- Sequence functions (len, sorted, reversed, enumerate, zip)
- Utility functions (any, all, filter, map, reduce)
- Practical built-in function applications
