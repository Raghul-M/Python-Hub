# Problem 1: Basic Iterator Usage
# Use iter() and next() with built-in iterables
# Iterate through lists, strings, and ranges
# Handle StopIteration exception
# Expected output: Iterator usage examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Creating Custom Iterators
# Create a custom iterator class with __iter__ and __next__
# Implement a simple counter iterator
# Expected output: Custom iterator behavior

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Basic Generator Functions
# Create generator functions using yield statement
# Generate sequences of numbers
# Expected output: Generator function results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Generator with Conditions
# Create generators with conditional yielding
# Filter or transform data as it's generated
# Expected output: Conditional generator results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Generator Expressions
# Use generator expressions for simple generators
# Create generators inline without function definition
# Expected output: Generator expression usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Infinite Generators
# Create generators that produce infinite sequences
# Use while loops with yield
# Expected output: Infinite sequence generation

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Generator with State
# Create generators that maintain state between yields
# Use variables to track progress
# Expected output: Stateful generator behavior

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Generator Pipeline
# Chain multiple generators together
# Pass data through a series of generators
# Expected output: Generator pipeline results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Memory Efficiency
# Compare memory usage of lists vs generators
# Demonstrate lazy evaluation benefits
# Expected output: Memory efficiency comparison

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Applications
# Create generators for real-world scenarios:
