STRINGS - Python Fundamentals Practice

This file contains practice problems covering string manipulation in Python.
Write your solutions after each problem statement.

Topics covered:
- String creation and indexing

- String methods (split, join, replace, strip, etc.)
- String formatting (%, .format(), f-strings)
- Escape characters and raw strings
- String comparison and searching

# Problem 1: String Creation and Indexing
# Create strings using different methods and demonstrate indexing
# Use single quotes, double quotes, triple quotes, and str()
# Access characters using positive and negative indices
# Expected output: String creation and indexing examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: String Slicing
# Demonstrate string slicing with different parameters
# Use start:end, start:end:step, negative slicing
# Expected output: Various sliced substrings

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Basic String Methods
# Use common string methods: upper(), lower(), title(), capitalize()
# Apply methods to transform string case
# Expected output: Case transformation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: String Search and Replace
# Use find(), index(), replace(), count() methods
# Search for substrings and replace content
# Expected output: Search and replace results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: String Splitting and Joining
# Use split() to break strings and join() to combine
# Handle different delimiters and join characters
# Expected output: Split and join operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: String Cleaning
# Use strip(), lstrip(), rstrip() to remove whitespace
# Clean strings from unwanted characters
# Expected output: Cleaned strings

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: String Formatting Methods
# Use % formatting, .format(), and f-strings
# Format strings with variables and expressions
# Expected output: Formatted strings

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Escape Characters and Raw Strings
# Use escape characters (\n, \t, \", \')
# Create raw strings with r"" prefix
# Expected output: Escape character usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: String Validation
# Check if strings start/end with specific patterns
# Validate string content (isalpha, isdigit, isalnum)
# Expected output: String validation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: String Manipulation
# Combine multiple string operations
# Create a function that processes text (remove extra spaces, capitalize)
# Expected output: Complex string manipulation

# Your solution here:
