# Problem 1: Dictionary Creation and Access
# Create dictionaries using different methods and access values
# Use curly braces, dict() constructor, and key-value pairs
# Access values using keys and handle missing keys
# Expected output: Dictionary creation and access examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Dictionary Methods
# Use common dictionary methods: get(), update(), pop(), clear()
# Handle missing keys and modify dictionary content
# Expected output: Dictionary method usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Dictionary Operations
# Perform dictionary operations: copying, merging, comparison
# Use copy(), update(), and comparison operators
# Expected output: Dictionary operation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Dictionary Iteration
# Iterate through dictionaries using different methods:
# - keys(), values(), items()
# - Direct iteration and enumerate()
# Expected output: Dictionary iteration examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Dictionary Comprehension
# Create dictionaries using dictionary comprehension
# Transform data and apply conditions
# Expected output: Dictionary comprehension examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Nested Dictionaries
# Work with nested dictionaries (dictionaries within dictionaries)
# Access and modify nested values
# Expected output: Nested dictionary operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Dictionary Default Values
# Use setdefault() and defaultdict for default values
# Handle missing keys gracefully
# Expected output: Default value handling

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Dictionary Sorting
# Sort dictionaries by keys and values
# Use sorted() with key functions
# Expected output: Sorted dictionary results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Dictionary Filtering
# Filter dictionaries based on conditions
# Use dictionary comprehension and filter()
# Expected output: Filtered dictionary results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Dictionary Applications
# Solve real-world problems using dictionaries:
# - Word frequency counter
# - Configuration management
# - Data grouping and aggregation
# Expected output: Practical dictionary solutions
