# Problem 1: Tuple Creation and Access
# Create tuples using different methods and access elements
# Use parentheses, tuple() constructor, and comma-separated values
# Access elements using indexing and slicing
# Expected output: Tuple creation and access examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 2: Tuple Methods
# Use tuple methods: count() and index()
# Count occurrences and find positions of elements
# Expected output: Tuple method usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 3: Tuple Immutability
# Demonstrate tuple immutability
# Try to modify tuples and handle the errors
# Expected output: Immutability demonstration

# Your solution here:


# Problem 4: Tuple Unpacking
# Use tuple unpacking to assign multiple values
# Unpack tuples into variables and handle different sizes
# Expected output: Tuple unpacking examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 5: Tuple Packing
# Create tuples by packing multiple values
# Use tuple packing in function returns and assignments
# Expected output: Tuple packing examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 6: Nested Tuples
# Work with nested tuples (tuples within tuples)
# Access and manipulate nested structures
# Expected output: Nested tuple operations

# Your solution here:


# Problem 7: Tuple Operations
# Perform tuple operations: concatenation, repetition, membership
# Use +, *, in operators with tuples
# Expected output: Tuple operation results

# Your solution here:


# Problem 8: Tuple Conversion
# Convert between tuples and other data structures
# Convert lists, strings, and other iterables to tuples
# Expected output: Tuple conversion examples

# Your solution here:


# Problem 9: Named Tuples
# Use collections.namedtuple to create named tuples
# Access elements by name and demonstrate benefits
# Expected output: Named tuple usage

# Your solution here:


# Problem 10: Practical Tuple Applications
# Solve real-world problems using tuples:
# - Return multiple values from functions
# - Use tuples as dictionary keys
# - Coordinate and point representations
# Expected output: Practical tuple solutions

# Your solution here:
